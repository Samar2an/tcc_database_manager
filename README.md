TCC Database Manager
====================

This Python script helps to add items to OS X's TCC.db sqlite database, which is useful in a distributed Apple-centric environment where a blanket TCC file would not work properly.

## Background

Apple's OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" introduced a feature which notifies users whenever an application attempts to gain access to their contacts (address book) or their computer's "Accessibility" options (such as screen overlays).  Whenever a user responds to one of these prompts, the computer stores the answer in an sqlite3 databased called "TCC.db".  In a single-user environment, this is usually a perfectly suitable solution without problems.

However, this system causes issues in distributed environments where applications may be added or removed at any time and the database file would need to be updated.  Constantly having to update this file for the template user would be tedious and could cause errors (what if you forgot to add one of the other applications?).

This script allows for applications to programmatically be added to the TCC database during our regular maintenance cycle.  In our environment, it's integrated in such a way that adding an entry to the TCC.db database is no more difficult than adding a single line of text to our files, which is significantly simpler than rebuilding the entire database file and uploading it to our main image server.

## Usage

`$ /path/to/tcc_database_manager serviceName bundleID`

Of course, help text is available.  Simply call the script with any of `h`, `-h`, `help`, `--help` to access it.

Aside from the help option to provide usage information, the script requires two arguments to be passed to it:

1. The service name, e.g. "kTCCServiceAddressBook" (for Contacts)
2. The bundle ID of the application, e.g. "com.apple.Finder" (for Finder)
  * Note: See [Finding Bundle IDs](#finding-bundle-ids) below for information on finding the bundle ID of the application.

If any additional arguments are passed to the script, it disregards them entirely.

#### Examples

* `$ /path/to/tcc_database_manager kTCCServiceAddressBook com.apple.Finder`
* `$ sudo /path/to/tcc_database_manager kTCCServiceAccessibility my.needy.Application`

Note that adding an application to the Accessibility keychain requires root access.  This is because all Accessibility settings are saved into `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` - saving these settings into a user's local TCC.db file will *not* work!

#### Finding Bundle IDs

As bundle IDs are the method Apple uses to manage its TCC databases, it's important to know how to find them for any application.  In general, they can be found in the application's `Info.plist` file.  If your application is located at `/Applications/MyAwesomeApp.app`, then the plist file will most likely be located at `/Applications/MyAwesomeApp.app/Contents/Info.plist`.  In particular, you'll need to search for the string corresponding to the key `CFBundleIdentifier`.

Brett Terpstra [detailed a shell script to help with this](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/07/31/overthinking-it-fast-bundle-id-retrieval-for-mac-apps/), which I will reproduce here for your convenience.  As bash is my primary shell, I put this into the end of my `~/.bash_profile` so I can call it easily at any time.

```bash
# Allows for searching of Bundle IDs by application name
# Written by Brett Terpstra
bid() {
	local shortname location

	# combine all args as regex
	# (and remove ".app" from the end if it exists due to autocomplete)
	shortname=$(echo "${@%%.app}"|sed 's/ /.*/g')
	# if the file is a full match in apps folder, roll with it
	if [ -d "/Applications/$shortname.app" ]; then
		location="/Applications/$shortname.app"
	else # otherwise, start searching
		location=$(mdfind -onlyin /Applications -onlyin ~/Applications -onlyin /Developer/Applications 'kMDItemKind==Application'|awk -F '/' -v re="$shortname" 'tolower($NF) ~ re {print $0}'|head -n1)
	fi
	# No results? Die.
	[[ -z $location || $location = "" ]] && echo "$1 not found, I quit" && return
	# Otherwise, find the bundleid using spotlight metadata
	bundleid=$(mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -r "$location")
	# return the result or an error message
	[[ -z $bundleid || $bundleid = "" ]] && echo "Error getting bundle ID for \"$@\"" || echo "$location: $bundleid"
}
```
Once this is in your source file, you can simply call it as a command and it will search for your application and return both the app's location and its bundle ID:
```
$ bid safari
/Applications/safari.app: com.apple.Safari
```

## Caveats

The script only recognizes three service names:

* `kTCCServiceAddressBook` (Contacts)
* `kTCCServiceUbiquity` (iCloud)
* `kTCCServiceAccessibility` (Accessibility)

As far as I am aware, these are the only service names that show up in TCC.db.  I made the script exclusive of other options to ensure no mistaken entries are created.

Additionally, this script assumes that the user wants to grant permission to the specified application.  In a desire to simplify execution of the script, I chose to remove the ability to deny access.  Adding such an option should not be too difficult, though.

### Location Services

Although it may seem that Location Services would fit into the same category as these services, Apple does not handle its Location Services requests through the TCC database system.  Instead it is handled through some plists - see [Location Services Manager](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/location_services_manager)

## Annoyances

Disappointingly, there does not seem to be an easy way to simply find out whether an application will request access to one of these services without opening the application and navigating it to a point where it asks for permission.  We have been investigating methods of programmatically discerning which of our applications will prompt the user to access different services, but have thus far been unsuccessful.  If you happen to know anything about this, we'd greatly appreciate any ideas.

It is worth noting that Apple has a method of automatically allowing certain applications access to services.  For example, in OS X 10.9 "Mavericks", TextEdit will automatically gain access to the `kTCCServiceUbiquity` service during its first launch, without any sort of prompt to the user.  We contacted Apple about utilizing this apparent backdoor for our machines so that we could just allow all requests to Contacts access (which would not pose an issue in our environment, I promise), but they informed us that this ability is hardcoded into the OS and we cannot access it.

There is also the mysterious `tccutil` command.  Its man page states:
```
DESCRIPTION
     The tccutil command manages the privacy database, which stores decisions the user has made about whether apps may
     access personal data.

     One command is current supported:

     reset    Reset all decisions for the specified service, causing apps to prompt again the next time they access the ser-
              vice.
```
I wish that this utility could be used to add access to a particular service for a specified application, or to completely open a service up and automatically accept all requests to it, or to turn off the service entirely so requests don't even exist... but none of this is possible.  The command only resets all access requests to a given service.

## Technical

Apple in fact has multiple TCC.db database files in any given installation of OS X 10.8 or newer (though none of them exist until the appropriate service is requested access to).  There is one for each user, in their `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC` folder, and there is one root database, located in `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC`.  The local databases (those in each user's directory) are responsible for Contacts access and iCloud access.  The settings for these applications are granted on a per-user, per-application basis this way.  However, Accessibility permissions are stored (and must be stored) in the `/Library/...` database.  I assume this is due to the nature of those types of applications that request Accessibility access (they are granted some freedoms to the machine that could potentially be undesirable, so administrative access is required to add them).

This script will add Accessibility requests to the `/Library/...` database (assuming it is run with root permissions).  The other requests will be added to the TCC database file located at `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`.  This is Apple's default directory for an individual user's settings.

If you would prefer a different default location, such as Apple's template user's home directory, the easiest solution would be to change the line

`options['local_dir'] = os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC')`

to

`options['local_dir'] = os.path.expanduser('/System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC')`

## Attribution

Much of the code used in this script was copy/pasted and then adapted from the `tccmanager.py` script written by Tim Sutton and published to his [GitHub repository](http://github.com/timsutton/scripts/tree/master/tccmanager).  We're very grateful to Tim for posting his code online freely; it has been very helpful to us.

Also, as mentioned above, thanks to Brett Terpstra for publishing his function to find bundle IDs online [at his website](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/07/31/overthinking-it-fast-bundle-id-retrieval-for-mac-apps/).

## Future Development
I may make it possible to remove entries as well in the future, though that generally isn't needed.  I may also make it possible to add applications by shortname or application bundle location.
